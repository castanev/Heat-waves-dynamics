Each code contains: 
  - A description of what the code generates  
  - An input section in which you must modify some variables and paths (specified in each code)

To calculate the streamfunction using the code 0_Streamfunction.ncl, you must create an environment and install NCL (conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf202003 ncl)

All the functions are in the file Funtions.py
