After running the codes, here should be created the following ncfiles with daily reanalysis data from NCEP (1948 to 2021):

- t1000_NCEP.nc: Surface air temperture (at 1000 hPa)
- u_300_NCEP.nc: zonal wind at 300 hPa 
- v_300_NCEP.nc: meridional wind at 300 hPa 
- sf_vp_300_1948-2022.nc: streamfunction at 300 hPa
